## About
This is a repository of my vector paintings.
You can use any of these images in your projects, works etc within the confines of the license.

<!-- But, please, make sure to check the [license rules](#license "Scroll to license rules") :) -->

**[Start exploring!](./SVG "See SVG images")**

**If you think that you have found a mistake or have sufficiently improved (including minification) something in this repository, you are very welcome to contact me [here](http://n-panuhin.info "Nikita Panuhin") or directly by [email](mailto:n.panuhin@mail.ru "Mailto: Nikita Panuhin").**

## Technical information

-   Adobe Illustrator files are built with *Illustrator CC* and are compatible with *Illustrator 17* and later versions.
-   SVG files are exported from Adobe Illustrator and then partly minified and beautified to fit some standards, as I see it. [See sample](./.github/SVG_sample.md "See SVG file sample")
-   PNG files are [rendered](./.github/render.py "See render.py file") using the *[convert-svg-to-png](https://github.com/neocotic/convert-svg/tree/master/packages/convert-svg-to-png "Node.js: convert-svg-to-png by neocotic")* Node.js package by [neocotic](https://github.com/neocotic "Github user: neocotic"). Render sizes are specified for each image in "SVG/{image\_name}/src/conf.json".

## License

Illustrator, SVG and other types of vector image files, as well as rendered PNG files, are made only by me, so:

-   You can modify all files, but if you want to distribute your work, you have to consider the first crossed out clause and follow the [MIT License](http://n-panuhin.info/license.html "MIT License")
-   Abuses of any form, as well as the deliberate deterioration of my work with the indication of my authorship, are strongly prohibited. -->

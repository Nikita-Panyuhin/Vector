## About
This is a repository of my vector paintings.
You can use any of these images in your projects, works etc within the confines of the license.

<!-- But, please, make sure to check the [license rules](#license "Scroll to license rules") :) -->

**[Start exploring!](./SVG "See SVG images")**

**If you think that you have found a mistake or have sufficiently improved (including minification) something in this repository, you are very welcome to contact me <a href="http://n-panuhin.info" title="Nikita Panuhin" target="_blank">here</a> or directly by [email](mailto:n.panuhin@mail.ru "Mailto: Nikita Panuhin").**

## Technical information

-   Adobe Illustrator files are built with *Illustrator CC* and are compatible with *Illustrator 17* and later versions.
-   SVG files are exported from Adobe Illustrator and then partly minified and beautified to fit some standards, as I see it. <a href="https://github.com/Nikita-Panyuhin/vector/blob/master/src/SVG_sample.md" title="See SVG file sample" target="_blank">See sample</a>
-   PNG files are rendered using the *<a href="https://github.com/neocotic/convert-svg/tree/master/packages/convert-svg-to-png" title="Node.js: convert-svg-to-png by neocotic" target="_blank">convert-svg-to-png</a>* Node.js package by <a href="https://github.com/neocotic" title="Github user: neocotic" target="_blank">neocotic</a>. Render sizes are specified for each image in "SVG/{image\_name}/src/conf.json".

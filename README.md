## About

This is a repository of my artwork that I made while studying vector graphics and 3D modeling. For vector graphics, the templates were taken from the Internet, but I drew all the vector images myself.

--------------------------------------

**[Vector graphics: SVG images](./SVG "Vector graphics: SVG images")**

**[3D modeling](./3D "Vector graphics: SVG images")**

--------------------------------------

You can use everything in this repository in your projects, works, etc. within the confines of the license.

### Vector graphics

Each SVG image has a colored or/and black-and-white version. You can download:

-   Beautified colored/black-and-white version
-   Compressed colored/black-and-white version
-   *Adobe Illustrator* source files

Links are located at the bottom of each page.

### 3D modeling



### Some technical information

-   Adobe Illustrator files are built with *Illustrator CC* and are compatible with *Illustrator 17* and later versions.
-   SVG files are exported from Adobe Illustrator and then partly minified and beautified to fit some standards, as I see it.
-   PNG files are rendered using the *<a href="https://github.com/neocotic/convert-svg/tree/master/packages/convert-svg-to-png" title="Node.js: convert-svg-to-png by neocotic" target="_blank">convert-svg-to-png</a>* Node.js package by <a href="https://github.com/neocotic" title="Github user: neocotic" target="_blank">neocotic</a>. Render sizes are specified for each image in "SVG/{image\_name}/src/conf.json".
-   The size of any SVG image is calculated without considering the size of the XML header (-40 bytes). SVG version is removed for compressed files (-14 bytes).
